# SanITyWorx.com

###General Info
-------------------------------------------
SanITyWorx.com is a hard drive tracking app for IT services when doing company wide backups.

###Purpose
-------------------------------------------
My father is an IT Profesional. When I started making web apps, he asked me to make one that would keep track of hard drive, their locations, cases that they are contained in, and when to do the next backup as well as which hard drive to use.

### User Experience
-------------------------------------------
Once the user logs in they will be greated with a dash board which tells them which backup is next, along with several tabs. In these tabs they can add Hard drives, cases, and locations. They can then edit and see corisponding items in relationship with their current item. Everything updates based on what the current items options are set to.
